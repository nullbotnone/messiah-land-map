# Messiah Land Map · 弥赛亚之地

An interactive relief map of first-century Israel, built on measured elevation
data rather than decorative terrain. Pan the land, tilt the horizon, and read
the Gospel narratives against the distances and height differences they actually
happened in.

**Live:** https://slashai.app/messiah-land-map/ (also at
https://nullbotnone.github.io/messiah-land-map/)

The interface reads in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese or English;
this document is the technical reference.

## What is on the map

| Layer | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Terrain | GMRT, resampled onto a 0.005° grid | 461 × 631 = 290,891 nodes, 34.20–36.50°E / 30.60–33.75°N |
| Coastline | Natural Earth 10m physical | Real shore, including the Carmel headland and the Bay of Haifa |
| Lakes | Natural Earth 10m physical | Sea of Galilee, Dead Sea, plus Lake Huleh reconstructed |
| Rivers | Natural Earth 10m river centrelines | Jordan (upper and lower), Yarmuk, Jabbok, Arnon, Zered, Kishon, Yarkon |
| Regions | Digitised from standard historical atlases | 10 polygons for the tetrarchy c. AD 30 |
| Places | 62 sites at surveyed coordinates | Gospel events, towns, and Decapolis cities |

Elevation in the sampled grid runs from **−429 m** (the Dead Sea surface) to
**2,773 m** (the Hermon massif). The true Hermon summit is 2,814 m — even a 550 m
grid smooths an isolated peak a little, and the map does not pretend otherwise.
It used to be a 2 km grid, where the same summit came out at 2,561 m.

### First-century corrections

Two features are drawn as they were around AD 30, not as they are today:

- **The Dead Sea** is drawn with the Lisan strait closed. The northern and
  southern basins were one body of water until the level dropped and they
  separated in 1979.
- **Lake Huleh** (Σεμεχωνῖτις) is restored. The lake and its marshes were drained
  in the 1950s and appear on no modern dataset.

### Political layer

The land was not one jurisdiction when Jesus was teaching in it. The map tints
each region by who governed it:

| Ruler | Territory |
| --- | --- |
| Herod Antipas | Galilee, Peraea |
| Herod Philip | Gaulanitis, Trachonitis |
| Roman prefect | Judaea, Samaria, Idumaea |
| Decapolis | autonomous Hellenistic cities |
| Nabataean kingdom | south and south-east |
| Province of Syria | Phoenicia, Ituraea |

Boundaries are an educational approximation — no authoritative GIS dataset
exists for them — but the place coordinates underneath are measured.

## Controls

### Jerusalem city view (c. AD 30)

The map scale switch and Jerusalem's place panel open a separate, lazy-loaded
Three.js city model. Returning preserves the regional map's selection, camera
and filters. Drag to orbit, right-drag to pan, scroll to zoom; two fingers pan
and zoom. Arrow keys orbit, `+` / `-` zoom and `0` restores the city view.
The site list also works with a keyboard and remains available without WebGL.

The model covers the Temple Mount — retaining walls, double porticoes,
Solomon's Portico, the Royal Stoa, the Huldah gates and their monumental stair,
Robinson's Arch over the Tyropoeon street, Wilson's Arch and the Xystus, the
inner courts and their six chambers, the altar with its ramp and the place of
slaughtering, and the sanctuary with its cells, its stepped approach and its
golden vine — the Antonia on its rock, Herod's western
palace and the three towers, the palatial mansion of the Upper City, Bethesda's
twin pools under five porticoes, Siloam and the stepped street, the Gihon
spring, the Kidron valley tombs, the Golgotha candidate in its quarry, the
first and second walls with their gates, Bezetha, Akeldama, the residential
hills, the three valleys and the Mount of Olives.

This is an **educational reconstruction**, not a surveyed ancient city.
Coordinates are local metres (east +x, south +z) from the traditional sanctuary
site at 31.778°N, 35.2354°E, and `y` is metres above sea level minus 600, so
every height in the model can be checked against a published elevation. Sites
are placed from the modern coordinates of the places themselves, so the
distances and bearings between them are real.

Terrain is SRTM 30 m sampled on a 50 m grid (`npm run build:dem:city`, written
into `app/jerusalem-data.ts` the same way the regional DEM is written into
`app/geo.ts`). Because two thousand years of debris have raised the valley
floors — the Herodian street beside the western wall lies some 15 m under
today's plaza — the Kidron, central and Hinnom valleys are cut back down to
their ancient floors. One vertical unit equals one horizontal metre; there is
no vertical exaggeration.

The esplanade follows the surviving retaining walls: 280 m on the south, 315 on
the north, 485 on the west and 470 on the east, turned about 9° from grid north,
with everything inside laid out in that turned frame. The sanctuary and courts
convert the literary dimensions of Mishnah Middot and Josephus at one cubit =
0.50 m. Elevations, facades, roofs, houses and olive groves remain
illustrations; houses and groves are deterministic and instanced.

The first wall's full course and height are approximate; the second wall's
inferred course is drawn with gaps, and it is that course which puts the
Golgotha candidate outside the city. Agrippa I's later third wall is omitted.
The Israel Museum's model represents **AD 66**, so it is used as an architectural
reference rather than copied as the city of Jesus's ministry. Coins under the
stepped street date its completion to Pilate's governorship, AD 26–36.

No source photographs or third-party 3D assets are redistributed. City strings
have explicit Chinese and English pairs, with Traditional generated by the same
OpenCC pipeline as the regional interface. GPU resources and animation frames
are released when leaving the city; rendering stops once controls settle.

`npm run check:jerusalem` validates site/source coverage, generated geometry
and the rendering budget; that the modelled ground matches twelve measured
elevations within 15 m and the retaining walls their published lengths within
12 m; that no landmark sprawls past the footprint of the thing it represents,
which is how a beam laid across its own colonnade shows up before anyone sees
it; and that the wall/site relationships the reconstruction rests on hold —
Golgotha outside both walls, Siloam and the palace inside the first.

The map follows Google Earth, so the gestures transfer without being learned:

| | |
|---|---|
| Drag | pan the land |
| Shift-drag, right-drag, middle-drag, Ctrl-drag | orbit — left and right rotate, up and down tilt |
| Wheel or trackpad pinch | zoom towards the pointer |
| Double-click | zoom into that point (Shift to zoom out) |
| Two fingers | pinch to zoom, twist to rotate, drag up and down to tilt |
| Arrow keys | pan; hold Shift to orbit |
| `+` `-` `0` | zoom in, zoom out, reset the view |
| Compass | click to face north |

Zooming holds whatever sits under the pointer in place. A projected point is
`centre + pan + Q · scale`, where `Q` depends only on the rotation and tilt and
`scale` is proportional to the zoom while those hold, so `zoomAbout()` in
`app/terrain.ts` corrects the pan in closed form rather than reprojecting.
`scripts/check-view.mjs` pins that down.

## Rendering

The map is a heightfield painted to a 2D canvas; there is no WebGL and no 3D
library. `app/terrain.ts` holds the whole renderer:

- **Projection** — rotation about the vertical axis plus a tilt. Axonometric by
  default; the ⏢ button in the view tools switches to a one-point perspective,
  where each point is scaled by `EYE / (EYE - z)` and `z` is how far it stands
  towards the camera. `EYE = 2.4` frame units, which puts the near edge about
  1.4× the far edge — lower it for a wider, heavier cone.
  `makeFrame()` projects the frame corners through the same transform and scales
  to fit, so nothing clips at any rotation, tilt or projection.
- **Shading** — hypsometric tint (the palette convention of printed relief
  atlases) multiplied by hillshade computed from the true surface gradient in
  metres, with a distance haze so depth reads without a fog overlay.
- **Depth ordering** — terrain cells and the Mediterranean go into one
  painter's-algorithm list, so the sea occludes correctly even at a low horizon.
  Land cells are clamped to the shoreline, which keeps the coast a clean line
  instead of a staircase of half-submerged cells.
- **Vertical exaggeration** — `EXAGGERATION = 5` in `app/terrain.ts`. At 1× the
  entire relief is 0.8% of the frame and invisible; printed relief atlases of
  this region use roughly 8–15×, so 5× reads flatter than an atlas and closer
  to the true profile. Two labels quote the figure; `npm run check:view` fails
  if they drift from it.
- **Responsiveness** — a coarse mesh draws immediately on interaction, the full
  mesh once the view settles. That full pass is most of three hundred thousand
  quads and takes about 310 ms, so the interactive one aims at a fixed budget of
  ~15,000 cells and works out its own stride (`DRAFT_STRIDE`) — change the grid
  step and the drag stays exactly as responsive.

Labels declutter greedily: dots always draw, names drop out when they would
collide with one already placed. Gospel sites outrank towns, the selected site
outranks everything, and a hidden label reappears on hover.

### Language toggle

The header carries a 简 / 繁 / EN toggle; the choice persists in `localStorage`.

Every visible string is authored in Simplified Chinese, and the canvas draws no
text, so the switch runs over DOM text nodes after each render instead of
threading a translation call through every component. Traditional is a script
conversion of that source, English a lookup in `app/en.json`; both start from
the Simplified text, so going 繁 → EN is not a double translation. Elements
marked `data-no-convert` are skipped — the toggle itself has to keep showing 简
and 繁 in their own scripts. `aria-label` attributes and `<html lang>` follow
the visible language.

#### Traditional

Shipping OpenCC to the browser would add roughly 6 MB of dictionaries for a
script toggle, so `scripts/build-zh-hant.mjs` runs OpenCC at build time and
emits `app/zh-hant.ts` — a table covering this site's vocabulary and nothing
else. It currently holds 233 characters and 10 phrases, and costs about 2.5 kB
gzipped.

The generator is careful about two things. Ambiguous characters (里 → 里 or 裡,
干 → 干 or 幹) take whichever reading this site's own text uses most, so the
phrase table only carries the minority cases. And phrase values always come from
converting the *whole* run, never a fragment — OpenCC reads `沿海干` out of
context as 沿海乾 and would otherwise poison the table. The script then asserts
that the emitted table reproduces OpenCC exactly across all 471 runs of Chinese
in the source, so a bad entry fails the build rather than the page.

Regenerate after changing any Chinese text:

```bash
npm run build:zh
```

#### English

`app/en.json` maps each Simplified string to its English form — 299 entries
covering the gazetteer, the region and water labels, the interface chrome and
every `aria-label`. Keys are the source text with whitespace collapsed, which is
how a DOM text node is looked up at runtime; surrounding whitespace is put back,
since a JSX text node often carries the space separating it from the next
element. A string with no entry falls through to Chinese rather than vanishing.

`scripts/check-en.mjs` extracts every user-visible Chinese string from
`page.tsx`, `places.ts` and `geo.ts` and reports what the table is missing or no
longer needs. Add English whenever you add Chinese:

```bash
npm run check:en                    # report gaps
node scripts/check-en.mjs --keys    # print the keys, ready to fill in
```

Because English words are wider than the Chinese they replace, the map's label
declutter measures the English name when English is active — otherwise most
labels would collide and drop out.

`app/geo.ts` and `app/zh-hant.ts` are generated and should not be hand-edited.

---

## Development

Requires Node ≥ 22.15 (`scripts/check-view.mjs` imports the TypeScript sources
directly, via type stripping and `module.registerHooks`).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # vinext dev server on :3000
npm run build:dem        # refetch the elevation grid from GMRT
npm run verify           # check the generated map data
npm run build:zh         # regenerate the Traditional Chinese table
npm run check:en         # check the English table is complete
npm run check:view       # check the pan/zoom maths
npm run check:videos     # check the embedded videos still resolve
npm run lint
```

Two build paths coexist:

```bash
npm run build            # vinext / Cloudflare Workers
npm run build:static     # static SPA into dist-static/ for GitHub Pages
npm run preview:static
```

The static build bundles the same client component as a plain SPA. Its base path
must match the path GitHub Pages serves it from: the workflow passes the
repository name as `PAGES_BASE`, and the config falls back to
`/messiah-land-map/` for a local build. Set `PAGES_BASE` yourself if you serve
it from anywhere else — a mismatch 404s the bundle and renders a blank page.

### Deployment

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs on every push to `main`: install, verify the
map data, confirm the Traditional Chinese table is current and the English table
complete, check the view maths, build the static bundle, deploy to GitHub Pages. A failing check
blocks the deploy.

---

## Verifying the data

```bash
npm run verify
```

`scripts/verify-map-data.mjs` decodes the DEM out of `app/geo.ts` and asserts:

1. the grid length matches the declared dimensions;
2. eight landmarks fall inside published survey ranges — Jerusalem, the Sea of
   Galilee and Dead Sea surfaces, Hermon, Jericho, the Hebron ridge, the Jezreel
   valley floor, and open sea off Ashdod (which catches a transposed axis);
3. every gazetteer entry sits inside the frame, and its stated elevation agrees
   with the surrounding DEM window.

Tolerances are wide on purpose. The check exists to catch typos, sign errors and
transposed coordinates, not to second-guess survey figures — and it has earned
its keep: it caught Masada and Hippos carrying *height above the shore* as their
elevation (434 m and 350 m, against true elevations of 59 m and 144 m).

---

## Regenerating `app/geo.ts`

The elevation half of the generator is `scripts/build-dem.mjs`; the vector half
is not checked in, since that data is static and was produced once. The pipeline
was:

1. Fetch the frame from the [GMRT](https://www.gmrt.org/) GridServer as one ESRI
   ASCII grid, resample onto a 0.005° grid, and pack the values as little-endian
   `Int16` and base64. GMRT serves a whole bounding box per request rather than
   metering by the hundred-coordinate call the way the point-query elevation APIs
   do, so the grid step is a choice about payload and draw cost rather than about
   quota — its tiers over a box this size run down to about 60 m.

   GMRT carries bathymetry, so the Mediterranean arrives as real depth. Nothing
   here wants that: the sea is drawn as flat bands clipped to the Natural Earth
   coastline, and a negative seafloor would drag `elevationRange` down and take
   the hypsometric ramp with it. Everything below zero outside the Jordan rift is
   written as 0; inside the rift the real depth is kept, which is what holds the
   Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Keep that rift box inland if you move it —
   at 33°N the shore is already out near 35.1°E — and `npm run verify` floors the
   whole grid at the Dead Sea's own depth to catch it if you do not.
2. Clip the Natural Earth 10m `land`, `lakes` and `rivers_lake_centerlines`
   layers to the frame, simplify with Douglas–Peucker, and take the coastline as
   the contiguous run of the land ring inside the frame.
3. Emit the whole thing as a TypeScript module alongside the hand-digitised
   region polygons.

One trap worth recording: Douglas–Peucker degenerates on a *closed* ring, where
the first and last points coincide and the perpendicular-distance term collapses
to zero — it silently reduced the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea to two points
each. Fall back to radial distance when the segment has no length.

## Videos

Seven places carry a BibleProject video, from `app/videos.ts`. The bar is
deliberately high: a video goes in only when it narrates the episode that
happened at that place.

That bar excludes most of the map, and it should. BibleProject makes book
overviews, theme videos, and a handful of narrative episode videos — it does not
make videos about towns. An overview of Mark is not a video about Gadara, and
putting one there tells the reader "here is the story of this place" when it is
nothing of the kind. Four videos clear the bar, covering the birth, the baptism,
the passion and the resurrection; the other fifty-five places show the card with
no video.

Acts stories belong to the sibling map. Damascus, Joppa, Caesarea, Samaria, Gaza
and Lydda carry no gospel reference in the gazetteer for exactly that reason, and
no video here either.

Nothing is requested from YouTube until a reader asks for it. The panel shows a
poster; the `<iframe>` is only created on click, and it is keyed by place id so
moving to another site takes the player back down. The poster deliberately has
no thumbnail — an image from `i.ytimg.com` would tell Google about everyone who
merely opened a panel, which is the thing the lazy embed exists to avoid. The
embed itself goes to `youtube-nocookie.com`.

`npm run check:videos` is the guard. Three things can rot here and none of them
show up in a type check: an id can be mistyped, a video can be pulled or made
private, and a channel can rename or reupload. YouTube's oEmbed endpoint answers
all three without an API key — it 404s on anything not publicly playable and it
reports the channel — so the check asserts every id still resolves and still
belongs to BibleProject. It also holds the mapping honest: every place named must
exist in the gazetteer, every video referenced must exist in the catalogue, and
every video in the catalogue must be used by something.

CI runs it on every push but is not allowed to fail the build on it, since an
outage at YouTube is no reason to stop shipping terrain.

BibleProject is not affiliated with this map. The videos are embedded and
credited in the panel, never rehosted.
